TODO:
 - Controls for moving and shooting the tank
 - In TankBase, make a shoot() function that spawns a bullet so we don't have to keep copy-pasting the bullet 
   spawning code
 - If a bullet hits the player, the player dies

TODO AFTER THAT:
 - Make some art
 - Transition to textures

Eventually:
 - Game over screen
 - Main menu
 - Enemy tanks
 - Whenever the player kills all the enemy tanks, generate a new and harder level
