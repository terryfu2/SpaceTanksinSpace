- The whole game uses continuous coordinates, NOT a grid. TextRenderer emulates a low-resolution screen
by rounding all positions and drawing them approximately where they should be.
Because of this, there might be some artifacts like objects appearing to be inside walls. This is only
a rendering artifact, and the object is not actually inside the wall.

- Most of the game's systems make use of an immutable Vector2f class to handle X and Y as a pair.

- We were trying to make bullets bounce off walls, but we couldn't get it working right in time for
the deadline, so it's temporarily disabled for this demo. As a result, Map.raycast() and RaycastHit
are unused for the time being.

- The map is procedurally generated, but for this demo, the seed is set to 0.

COMMANDS:
- move <x> <y> -- move X pixels horizontally and Y pixels vertically. Each square is 32 pixels.
- aim <d> -- aim the turret D degrees anticlockwise from (0, 1)
- shoot -- shoot a bullet where the turret is aiming
- exit -- exit the demo
- [empty line] -- allow one second to pass (useful for watching bullets moving)

SYMBOLS:
[] -- a wall
x -- the player's tank
. -- a bullet
